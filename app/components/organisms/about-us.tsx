                            Rebase Code Camp was born out of the realization
                            that there is a pressing need to address the
                            increasing demand for digital skills and the
                            ever-widening gap between traditional education and
                            the specific requirements of industries.

                            We recognized the limitations of conventional
                            schools that focus on providing general education
                            and certificates, while falling short in equipping
                            students with the practical proficiency needed to
                            excel in the job market.
